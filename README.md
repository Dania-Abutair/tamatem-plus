# Vuetify

I used Vuetify instead of material design.

Every component in Vuetify is handcrafted under the guise of Google’s Material Design specification and comes with hundreds of customization options that fit any style or design; even if it’s not Material. Write Vue templates that are as concise or verbose as you want using exlusively or a combination of props, slots, and components.
